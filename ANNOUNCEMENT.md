# Fresh Keep - LinkedIn Announcement Post

**Fresh Keep is live on the App Store!**

After weeks of building, testing, and iterating, I'm excited to share that Fresh Keep is officially available for download on iOS.

Fresh Keep helps you reduce food waste by tracking what you have at home, alerting you before items expire, and generating AI-powered recipes with the ingredients you already own.

**Key features:**
- Scan product labels with your camera to add items instantly
- Get smart expiration alerts so nothing goes to waste
- Generate personalized recipes with AI using what's in your kitchen
- Track your meals and nutrition
- Visualize your consumption vs. waste with detailed statistics

**Android users — I need your help!**

I'm looking for **14 testers** to join the closed testing program so I can publish Fresh Keep on Google Play. If you have an Android device and want early access, send me a DM or drop a comment below.

It only takes a minute to join and you'll be among the first to try it out.

## Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights for the Next.js 14.2 project with App Router.

### Changes Made

1. **Installed @vercel/speed-insights package**
   - Added `@vercel/speed-insights@^1.3.1` to dependencies using npm
   - Updated package.json and package-lock.json

2. **Updated app/layout.tsx**
   - Imported `SpeedInsights` component from `@vercel/speed-insights/next`
   - Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the `<body>` tag after `{children}` and `<Analytics />`
   - This follows the recommended pattern for Next.js 13.5+ with App Router

### Implementation Details

The project is using Next.js 14.2.0 with the App Router pattern, so the Speed Insights component was added directly to the root layout file (app/layout.tsx). The component is placed at the end of the body tag, which is the recommended location for optimal performance tracking.

The implementation follows Next.js best practices:
- Import from `@vercel/speed-insights/next` for App Router projects
- No client-side directive needed (the component handles it internally)
- Placed after children for proper rendering order

### Verification

- ✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
- ✅ All static pages generated correctly
- ✅ TypeScript types validated
- ✅ Package manager lock file updated

### Files Modified

- `app/layout.tsx` - Added SpeedInsights import and component
- `package.json` - Added @vercel/speed-insights dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependency tree

The Speed Insights component will now automatically track and report Core Web Vitals and other performance metrics when deployed to Vercel.

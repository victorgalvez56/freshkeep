Changes Made:
1. Installed @vercel/analytics package (v1.6.1)
   - Added as a production dependency in package.json
   - Updated package-lock.json with all dependencies

2. Modified app/layout.tsx (App Router)
   - Added import: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
   - Added <Analytics /> component inside <body> tag, after {children}
   - Preserved all existing code structure, metadata, and styling

3. Build Verification
   - Successfully ran `npm run build`
   - No errors or warnings introduced
   - All static pages generated successfully (9/9 pages)
   - TypeScript type checking passed
   - Linting passed

Implementation Details:
- This is an App Router project (Next.js 14.2 with TypeScript)
- Analytics component placed in the root layout (app/layout.tsx)
- Component positioned after {children} inside the <body> tag per best practices
- All existing imports, metadata, font configuration, and styling preserved
- The Analytics component will track page views and web vitals automatically

The Vercel Web Analytics is now fully configured and will start collecting anonymous analytics data when deployed to Vercel.
